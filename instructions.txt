The chain goes in a spiral starting in the top left
The indexes of cans starts at 0
If everything is red past a certain point, it's something that's important in the chain
If it makes no sense and keeps flashing and stuff, check PDH
If one motor is red but it doesn't break the chain, check the sensor 
Just because everything's green doesn't mean it's actually good >:( I don't trust my code that much and neither should you, check it!!!

TODO: make it easier to figure out whats what on the actual robot (in the meantime, check the swerve modules in /src/main/deploy/swerve/neo/modules)
